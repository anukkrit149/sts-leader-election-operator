# Deployment Configuration Summary

This document summarizes the deployment configuration implemented for the StatefulSet Leader Election Operator.

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Enhanced Deployment Configuration

1. **Resource Management**
   - CPU requests: 50m, limits: 200m
   - Memory requests: 128Mi, limits: 256Mi
   - Ephemeral storage requests: 100Mi, limits: 1Gi

2. **Health Checks**
   - Liveness probe: `/healthz` endpoint with proper timeouts
   - Readiness probe: `/readyz` endpoint with proper timeouts
   - Startup probe: Enhanced startup detection with 30 failure threshold

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Non-root user (65532)
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Dropped all capabilities
   - Seccomp profile enabled
   - Node affinity for multi-architecture support

4. **High Availability**
   - 2 replicas in production configuration
   - Pod Disruption Budget ensuring 1 replica minimum
   - Topology spread constraints for node/zone distribution
   - Rolling update strategy with controlled rollout

5. **Observability**
   - Structured JSON logging with configurable levels
   - Prometheus metrics on port 8443
   - Service Monitor for Prometheus Operator integration
   - Environment variables for runtime configuration

### ✅ Installation Manifests

1. **Standard Installation** (`dist/install.yaml`)
   - Single replica configuration
   - Basic resource limits
   - Suitable for development/testing

2. **Production Installation** (`dist/install-production.yaml`)
   - Enhanced configuration with HA
   - Comprehensive security settings
   - Production-ready resource limits

### ✅ Build System Integration

1. **Makefile Targets**
   - `make build-installer`: Generate standard installation manifest
   - `make build-installer-production`: Generate production manifest
   - `make deploy`: Deploy standard configuration
   - `make undeploy`: Remove operator

2. **Kustomize Configuration**
   - Modular configuration structure
   - Patch-based customization
   - Environment-specific overlays

### ✅ Validation and Testing

1. **Deployment Validation Script** (`scripts/validate-deployment.sh`)
   - Automated deployment verification
   - Health endpoint testing
   - RBAC permission validation
   - Basic functionality testing

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive deployment guide (`docs/deployment.md`)
   - Installation instructions (`config/install/README.md`)
   - Troubleshooting procedures

## Configuration Files Created/Modified

- `Makefile` - Added production installer target

## Deployment Options

### Development
```bash
make deploy
```

### Production
```bash
make build-installer-production
kubectl apply -f dist/install-production.yaml
```

### Validation
```bash
./scripts/validate-deployment.sh
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: Enhanced pod and container security contexts
2. **Reliability**: Multiple replicas with proper disruption budgets
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
4. **Scalability**: Resource limits and topology constraints
5. **Maintainability**: Modular configuration and documentation

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **9.1**: Comprehensive installation manifests with proper configuration
- ✅ **9.4**: Complete installation manifests for various deployment scenarios

The deployment configuration provides a production-ready operator with enhanced security, reliability, and observability features while maintaining flexibility for different deployment environments.
